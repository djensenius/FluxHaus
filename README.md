Login and query Miele and Bosch home appliances and integrate some HomeKit scenes. 

Written in SwiftUI. This queries OpenWeather API, HomeConnect (for Bosch), and Miele APIs to quickly get data.

Quickly written for personal use, might update occasionally. Happy to take PRs to make things a bit less specific.
